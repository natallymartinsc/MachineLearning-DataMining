# Pattern Recognition Repository

This repository was created to store and share the codes developed throughout the **Pattern Recognition** course. Here, I apply the knowledge acquired in class through practical examples and projects.

## Course Content

Throughout the course, we covered the following topics:

- **Introduction to Pattern Recognition:** Basic concepts and foundational theories in pattern recognition
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for preparing data, including normalization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction
- **Machine Learning:** Overview of machine learning algorithms and their applications in pattern recognition
- **Data Clustering:** Methods for grouping data into meaningful clusters, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering
- **Classification Algorithms:** Study of different classifiers, including support vector machines (SVMs) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- **Decision Trees:** Understanding tree-based models for decision making and classification tasks
- **Artificial Neural Networks:** Introduction to neural networks and their application in recognizing complex patterns


## Repository Structure 
- `/classesCode/`: Contains practice code and algorithm implementations developed on class.
- `/personalProjects/`: Applying the knowledge on personal projects.
- `/finalProject/`: The final project
