# Patter Recognition Course Repository

## **Description:** 
This repository was created to store and share the codes develioed throughout the Pattern Recognition course. Here, i apply the knoledge acquired in class through pratical examples and projects.

Course Content: Throughout the course, we covered the following topics:
1. Introduction to Patter Recognition
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Machine Learning
4. Data Clustering
5. Classification algorithms
6. Decision Trees
7. Artificial Neural Networks


## Repository organization
